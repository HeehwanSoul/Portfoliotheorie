# Portfoliotheorie


# Project Description
The project is organized in two parts:

**1. Implementation of the Forward and Backward Euler Methods:**

The forward and backward Euler methods are implemented in _odesolver.py_. These methods are used to solve a parabolic partial differential equation.

**2. Jupyter Notebook:**

The relation between stiffness and eigenvalues is explained and the result of the experiment with forward(explicit) and backward(implicit) Euler Methods are reported. In addition, the convection-diffusion equation is solved.
